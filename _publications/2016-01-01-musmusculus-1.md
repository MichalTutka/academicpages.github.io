excerpt: 'I worked with Sandra Troxell-Smith to examine mouse foraging strategies in response to predation 
risk. I designed an ancillary experiment to study the effect of auditory cues on giving-up densities. I conducted original research, produced my first thesis, and 
presented my work at the UIC Student Research Forum. This study earned me a nomination for the Elmer Hadley Award and a co-authorship on our peer-reviewed publication.'
