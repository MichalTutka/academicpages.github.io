About
======
Hi, I'm Michal, and welcome to my page. I'm currently learning Git to help become more proficient with coding and data science. I'm an incoming masters student to the Water Resources Engineering program at Oregon State University, and will be working with Dr. Desiree Tullos. Obtaining my graduate degree is an important step towards becoming a competent engineer. I'm specifically interested in floodplain and stormwater management and want to learn more about the challenges of these study areas, and how to apply engineering practices for the benefit of people and the environment.

Here on my page, you can check out my CV, talks, published work, and learn more about me and my passions. Thanks for stopping by!
